// I set myName to a string and build myStr with myName between the strings "My name is " and " and I am well!"
// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Norman Heath";
var myStr = "My name is "+ myName + "and I am well!";
